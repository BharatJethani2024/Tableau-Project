# Tableau-Project

Problem Statement:

AtliQ Hardware, a leading supplier of computer hardware and peripherals, faces significant challenges in tracking and gaining insights into its sales amidst a dynamically growing market. Bhavan Patel, the Sales Director, is frustrated by the lack of comprehensive and accurate information provided by the regional managers, who often present overly optimistic or convoluted verbal reports. The current method of managing sales data involves receiving numerous Excel files from various regional offices, each containing extensive rows of data. This inundation of raw data makes it challenging for Bhavan to extract actionable insights or identify areas for business improvement. He desires a simplified and easily understandable overview of the company's performance, preferably in the form of visual dashboards. The goal of this project is to develop a Power BI solution that provides Bhavan with real-time, accurate, and visually intuitive insights into AtliQ Hardware's sales performance. The solution should aggregate data from multiple sources, allowing Bhavan to easily track sales trends, identify underperforming regions, and make informed, data-driven decisions to drive sales growth.

Key Objectives:

Aggregate sales data from multiple regional offices into a centralized Power BI platform. Develop interactive dashboards and visualizations that provide Bhavan with clear insights into sales performance across different regions. Implement features such as trend analysis, revenue breakdowns, and customer segmentation to aid in decision-making. Enable automated monthly email reports to keep Bhavan informed about the company's performance without the need for manual data retrieval. By delivering a user-friendly Power BI solution, this project aims to empower Bhavan Patel with the tools necessary to make strategic decisions and drive sales growth for AtliQ Hardware.
